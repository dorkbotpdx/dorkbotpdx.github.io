    <p>So, it's come to my attention (thanks to Audrey and Mark) that TechShop is going to be opening a 
      Portland facility sometime in the middle of 2008. For those of you who don't know about it, 
      TechShop is pure geek heaven. It's a DIY facility that stocks the tools to build pretty much anything. 
      You can become a member at various levels and have access to everything from machine tools to laser 
      cutters and probably any sort of woodworking device you can imagine.

      did a great walk through of the original Menlo Park location. You can find out more about the Portland facility
